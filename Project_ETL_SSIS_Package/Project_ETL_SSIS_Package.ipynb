    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create an ETL pipeline with SSIS. ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. We will Extract our data from a flat file source, Transform it and Load it into a relational database. Our flat file source will be a CSV file (part of the GreenConstruct Sales Database - you can download it from here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdagteki/etl-projects/main/Project_ETL_SSIS_Package/GreenConstruct_Sales_Dataset_Long.csv)\n",
