A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n\nThe study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.\n\n\nExplore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n\nHere is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"| Field Name    |
